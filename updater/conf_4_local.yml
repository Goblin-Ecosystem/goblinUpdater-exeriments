metrics:
  # list of couples with metric: metric name and coef: double
  # - at least one quality metric
  # - at least one cost metric
  # - sum of coefs for quality metrics must be 1
  - metric: FRESHNESS
    coef: 1.0
  - metric: COST
    coef: 0.0
constraints:
  # list (possibly empty) of constraints with constraint: and value:
  # a constraint can be one of:
  # - constraint: COST_LIMIT and value: double -> maximum value of total cost of solution (not used if COST is not part of the metrics)
  # - constraint: CVE_LIMIT and value: double -> maximum value of total CVE of solution (not used if CVE is not part of the metrics)
  # - constraint: PRESENCE and value: some id -> id must be present in solution
  # - constraint: ABSENCE and value: some id -> id must be absent in solution
  # notes:
  # - if you use both PRESENCE and ABSENCE for some same id, there is no solution
  # - if you use COST_LIMIT and no solution exist under this limit, there is no solution
  - constraint: COST_LIMIT
    value: 0.0

  # can be empty to select all, default is [MORE_RECENT]

costs:
  # either NONE, LOCAL (default), CONSTRAINTS, LOCAL_AND_CONSTRAINTS, or GLOBAL
