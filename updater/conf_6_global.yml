metrics:
  # list of couples with metric: metric name and coef: double
  # - at least one quality metric
  # - at least one cost metric
  # - sum of coefs for quality metrics must be 1
  - metric: CVE
    coef: 0.2
  - metric: FRESHNESS
    coef: 0.4
  - metric: POPULARITY_1_YEAR
    coef: 0.4
  - metric: COST
    coef: 0.5
constraints:
# list (possibly empty) of constraints with constraint: and value:
# a constraint can be one of:
# - constraint: COST_LIMIT and value: double -> maximum value of total cost of solution (not used if COST is not part of the metrics)
# - constraint: CVE_LIMIT and value: double -> maximum value of total CVE of solution (not used if CVE is not part of the metrics)
# - constraint: PRESENCE and value: some id -> id must be present in solution
# - constraint: ABSENCE and value: some id -> id must be absent in solution
# notes:
# - if you use both PRESENCE and ABSENCE for some same id, there is no solution
# - if you use COST_LIMIT and no solution exist under this limit, there is no solution
releases:
  # either NONE, LOCAL (default), CONSTRAINTS(NONE + all releases of libs in ABSENCE & PRESENCE), LOCAL_AND_CONSTRAINTS (LOCAL + all libs of releases in ABSENCE), or GLOBAL
  focus: GLOBAL
  # combination of MORE_RECENT, NO_PATCHES
  # can be empty to select all, default is [MORE_RECENT]
  # (!!) by now only [MORE_RECENT] is supported (others -> [MORE_RECENT])
  selectors: [MORE_RECENT]
costs:
  # either NONE, LOCAL (default), CONSTRAINTS, LOCAL_AND_CONSTRAINTS, or GLOBAL
  focus: GLOBAL
  # default value for NONE or unknown costs, MAX or MIN
  default: MAX
  # tool used to compute costs at LOCAL level, either NONE or MARACAS (default)
  tool-direct: MARACAS
  # tool used to compute costs at non-root level, either NONE (default) or JAPICMP
  tool-indirect: JAPICMP
